## Analysis:

### Analysis of insert()

Analyze your insert() function with respect to the number of nodes in the list.

```python
Step 1:
Let the n represent the node we are inserting. Let T(n) represent node of operations.

Step 2:
              def insert(self, data):

                           new_node = self.Node(data)  //1

                           self.count += 1             //1

 

                           # If first node is inserted to empty list

                           if self.front == None:

                                         self.front = new_node //1

                                         self.back = new_node //1

                                         self.front.prev = None //1

                                         return

 

                           # if the data of new node is less than front data, inserting it to the front

                           # and making front as new node

                           if new_node.data < self.front.data:

                                         self.front.prev = new_node  //1

                                         new_node.next = self.front  //1

                                         self.front = new_node                          //1

                                         return                                          //1

 

                           # if the data inserted has a value greater than the back node, insert it to the last

                           # and make back as new node

                           if new_node.data > self.back.data:

 

                                         new_node.prev = self.back   //1

                                         self.back.next = new_node   //1

                                         self.back = new_node                          //1

                                         return                                          //1

 

                           # Find the node before which we need to insert new_node.

                           temp = self.front

                           while temp.data < new_node.data:              //n

                                         temp = temp.next                                  //n+1

 

                           # Insert new node before temp

                           temp.prev.next = new_node                           //n+1

                           new_node.prev = temp.prev                           //n+1

                           temp.prev = new_node                       //n+1

                           new_node.next = temp                       //n+1


Step 3: 

T(n) = 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 + n + n+1 + n+1 + n+1 + n+1 + n+1

Step 4:

T(n) = 18 + 6n
  = O(1) + O(n)
  = O(n)

Step 5:

Hence, T(n) is O(n).
```

 

### Analysis of remove()

Analyze your remove() function with respect to the number of nodes in the list

```python
Step 1:
Let the n represent the node we are inserting .Let T(n) represent node of operations .

Step 2:

def remove(self, data):

                           current = self.front     //1

                           node_deleted = False      //1

 

                           if current is None:

                                         node_deleted = False             //1

                            elif current.data == data:

                                         self.front = current.next         //1

                                         if self.front:

                                                       self.front.prev = None            //1

                                         node_deleted = True //1

                           elif self.back.data == data:

                                         self.back = self.back.prev //1

                                         self.back.next = None //1

                                         node_deleted = True //1

                           else:

                                         while current: //n

                                                       if current.data == data:

                                                                    current.prev.next = current.next      //n+1

                                                                    current.next.prev = current.prev     //n+1

                                                                    node_deleted = True //1

                                                       current = current.next                          //n+1

 

                           if node_deleted:

                                         self.count -= 1             //1

                                         if self.count == 0:

                                                       self.front = None         //1

                                                       self.back = None         //1

                                         return True     //1

                           return False    //1
 

Step 3:

T(n) = 18 + 3n

 

Step 4:

T(n) = 18 + 3n
  = O(1) + O(n)
  = O(n)

Step 5:

Hence, T(n) is O(n).

```
 

### Analysis of is_present()

Analyze your is_present() function with respect to the number of nodes in the list

```python
Step 1:

Let the n represent the node we are inserting .Let T(n) represent node of operations needed to count the nodes in the list.

 Step 2:


def is_present(self, data):

                           for node_val in self._iter_(): //n

                                         if data == node_val:               

                                                       return True                   //1

                           return False                  //1   

    

Step 3:

T(n) = n + 1 + 1

 

Step 4:

T(n) = n + 1 + 1
     = n+2
     = O(n)

 
Step 5:

Hence, T(n) is O(n).
```

### Analysis of \_\_len\_\_()

 

Analyze your ```__len()__``` function with respect to the number of nodes in the list

 
```python
Step 1:

Let the n represent the node we are inserting .Let T(n) represent node of operations needed to count the nodes in the list.

 

Step 2:

def _len_(self):

                           return self.count         //(Taken as n)



Step 3:

T(n) = n

 
Step 4:

T(n) = n (As for counting it needs iteration through all the linked list)

 

Step 5:

Hence, T(n) is O(n).
```

## Reflection

### Tell us what you found most challenging when implementing your assignment. What helped you overcome your challenges, what was most useful?

### The Insertion And Remove Function was one of the most difficult to implement because we needed to figure out how to insert/remove from the front, back, middle, and all in a sorted manner. The diagram and class notes were crucial in overcoming the challenges. This comprehensive lab cleared up any doubts we had about pushing and popping elements and prepared us for the upcoming tests.
